Welcome to my website!
======

I am a PhD candidate at [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/), in Paris, and [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), supervised by [Vincent Viguié](https://www.vincentviguie.com/) and [Felix Creutzig](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/about/team/creutzig-felix.html).

My main research interests are urban economics and urban modeling for environmental policy evaluation and distributional impacts analysis.
