Welcome to my website!
======

I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Institut de Ciència i Tecnologia Ambientals](https://www.uab.cat/web/icta-1345819904184.html) of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB) in the ERC CLIMGROW project. My main research interests are climate policy evaluation and distributional impact analysis, with a focus on the urban level.

I obtained my PhD in March 2024 from [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/) and [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), under the supervision of [Vincent Viguié](https://www.vincentviguie.com/) and [Felix Creutzig](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/about/team/creutzig-felix.html). The main focus of my Ph.D. research was on applying a collection of spatially explicit urban economics models to a sample of 100+ cities of various characteristics in different continents for climate policy modeling (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01138-0), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166046222000710), and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235234092300080X)). I have also worked on the distributional impacts of urban climate policies (see [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232200196X?via%3Dihub)).
