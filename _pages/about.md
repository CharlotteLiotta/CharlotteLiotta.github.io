Welcome to my website!
======

I am a PhD candidate at [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/), in Paris, and [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), supervised by [Vincent Viguié](https://www.vincentviguie.com/) and [Felix Creutzig](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/about/team/creutzig-felix.html). My main research interests are urban economics and urban modeling for environmental policy evaluation and distributional impacts analysis.

The main focus of my Ph.D. is on applying a collection of spatially explicit urban economics models to a sample of 100+ cities of various characteristics in different continents for climate policy modeling (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01138-0), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166046222000710), and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235234092300080X)). I am also interested in the distributional impacts of urban climate policies (see [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669232200196X?via%3Dihub)).

Before my Ph.D., I worked for the World Bank on [flood modeling and urban resilience](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099527102062332327/pdf/IDU0e0eee23a036c7040f20898009edeafa81b36.pdf) and on the [distributional impacts of urban climate policies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4494028). I did my economics master thesis at CIRED, France, and at the French Ministry of Environment on the topic of [environmental justice and urban greening in the Paris metropolitan area](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S146290111931086X?via%3Dihub).
